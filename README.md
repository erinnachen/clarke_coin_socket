# Clarke Coin Socket
The new rage for 2016 is those digital currencies, and the only one trading in the Turing School basement is Clarke Coin. Did you know that [Joan Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Clarke) was a gifted numismatist and really into [gold unicorns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(coin))? Well now you know.

Bitcoin is built on the idea of distributed actors, but to deal with the lack of peers in a nascent system the first full node implementation was built as an [HTTP client](https://github.com/worace/clarke-coin). This application is an extension of Clarke Coin in order to bring other types of clients into the ecosystem. It is also ongoing as an exploration of the capabilities of the [Phoenix Framework.](http://www.phoenixframework.org/)

## Old stuff
To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).
